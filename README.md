# Dementia_Alarm_System

I created a dementia security system for my mum...

The system

Alert Pull Chords
Fall Sensor
Potential for Bed Pressure pad sensor
Potential for PIR Motion sensors
The System had the following ways of alerting you to change in situation:

Tablet mounted on a wall (buttons change colour to show status of various alarm triggers)
SMS (text messages) relating where the issue has occurred.(Using node-red-contrib-nexmo)
Phone Calls relating where the issue has occurred.(Using node-red-contrib-nexmo)
Audible alarms possible.....
